favourable energy states of a 2D hydrophilic/phobic string

Class assignment: A brute-force search to determine the folding states of a sequence of string consisting of "H" and "P" fold in a two-dimensional lattice with a minimum energy state. The string needs to be input such as a sequence of 8 characters need to be entered as `"HPHPPHHH"`
